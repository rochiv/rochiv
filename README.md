## Work @ NextGen Federal Systems

- Architecting **GenAI systems** with **AWS Bedrock**, **vector search (OpenSearch)**, and **GraphRAG on Neo4j** for secure document understanding.
- Building **AI agents** and **MCP tools** that orchestrate retrieval, analysis, and workflows inside chat-style interfaces.
- Owning ML infra with **AWS CDK**, **SageMaker**, and containerized services for repeatable, observable deployments.

## Projects & Research

- **GenAI Document Systems**: RAG/GraphRAG pipelines over large technical corpora using Bedrock, OpenSearch, and Neo4j.
- **Deep Learning Weather Forecasting**: Aurora weather model inference on ERA5/GRIB data for global forecasts.
- **3D Medical Imaging (WVU)**: 3D U-Net models on 1TB+ PET/CT data for lesion segmentation and related diagnostic tasks.
- **Multimodal Federated Learning in Healthcare**: Co-authored a survey covering 50+ works in FL + medical AI. Find the title [Multimodal Federated Learning in Healthcare: a Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09650) on arXiv.
